This is a template repository for creating a waitlist using Next.js 14, Neon PostgreSQL for data storage, Drizzle ORM for database operations, Upstash Redis for rate limiting, and Resend for sending emails with a custom domain.

The UI is built using a mix of shadcn/ui, Magic UI and Tailwind CSS.

**Demo:** [https://greenleaf-waitlist.vercel.app](https://greenleaf-waitlist.vercel.app)

## Features

- **Next.js 14**: The most popular React framework
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Serverless Postgres database for storing waitlist subscribers
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe, lightweight SQL ORM for database operations
- **Upstash Redis**: Use Upstash Redis to rate limit the number of signups
- **Resend**: Send beautiful transactional emails to waitlist subscribers
- **Vercel**: Deploy the app to Vercel with a single click
- **shadcn/ui**: Beautiful, accessible UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS

## How to get started?

There are a few things you need to set up before using this template:

### 1. Neon PostgreSQL

1. Sign up for a free account at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Create a new project
3. In your project dashboard, click on "Connection Details" to get your connection string
4. Copy the connection string that looks like: `postgresql://user:password@hostname/database`

This connection string will be used as your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

### 2. Upstash Redis

1. Sign up for a free account at [upstash.com](https://upstash.com)
2. Create a new Redis database
3. After creation, navigate to the "REST API" section
4. Copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` values

These will be used as environment variables in your project.

### 3. Resend

1. Sign up for a Resend account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Navigate to API Keys in your dashboard
3. Create a new API key and copy it
4. For production use, add and verify your domain under the "Domains" section

The API key will be used as your `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable.
